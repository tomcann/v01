New update to demosrate a pull into the local branch

“An occurrence happens when the same portion of the file has been modified in two separate histories.  For example Sam makes a change and issues a pull request and merges successfully to master.  The next day Ann decides to do the same, except Sam introduced a change to the file that conflict with what Ann has done.  In some cases, Git is smart enough to resolve conflicts, but others it may have to be done manually. 
In this lecture we will walk through the process to resolve a merge conflict. An additional point that is needed to know, you will need a tool to assist you to review and resolve merge conflicts and Git by itself in not enough.  The use of beyond compare 4 is suggested, others are available.  Git also needs to be informed about the tool.
For Beyond Compare type: git config --global merge.tool bc2    for beyond compare, which I have installed
Also type: git config –global mergetool.bc2 trustExitCode true
Instructions on how to configure various tools can be found online
Ok, let’s cause a merge issue and resolve it:
Go to GitHub to modify the Readme.md file again”
